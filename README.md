# AQI-MAPS

  # Project title 
  
      This project is intitled to be called Air Quality Index which basically tells Real time air quality
      data with help of maps made from Qgis software and intended to get updated in every 30 minutes.
      
 # Motivation 
     This project was Build up on knowedge I gain from IIRS outreach programme organised by ISRO.
       This project intend's to view Air pollution with modern sophisticated approch of real time based Maps.
         This project Helps indiviual to view climate change problem with more practical approach.

# Technology used
            
   It is an real time based AQI maps created from QGIS ,MAPBOX.GL AND OPEN-STREET MAPS.
QGIS-QGIS functions as geographic information system (GIS) software, allowing users to analyze and edit spatial information, in addition to composing and exporting graphical maps. QGIS supports both raster and vector layers; vector data is stored as either point, line, or polygon features. Multiple formats of raster images are supported, and the software can georeference images.
MAPBOX-GL-The Mapbox Maps SDK is a suite of proprietary – formerly open-source – libraries developed by Mapbox for embedding customizable slippy maps in Web, mobile, and desktop applications. There is also a library for building server-side or command-line rendering tools. The MapLibre project maintains a fork of the last free and open source versions.
